# Compound Interest Calculator

Frustrated at the lameness of all the compound interest calculators I either found online or downloaded from the App Store, I decided to make my own.

This project is pretty straightforward in that it does what it says on the tin, while also offering three themes and a few currency options, with user-provided values saved via localStorage.
